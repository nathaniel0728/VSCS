                <h2>How do Technologists work with Engineers in Atmosphere Moisture and Storm Mapping Program?</h2>
                <p>The technologists are responsible for the internal/software and physical parts of the instruments necessary to carry out data collection. They must collaborate with the engineers to understand how the instruments should be shaped or programmed to fit in properly with the necessary aircrafts or satellites. The engineers in turn should require the technologists to provide them with the specifics of the instruments in order to design the aircrafts/satellites as efficiently as possible based on the needs of the instruments.</p>
                
                <h2>What role do technologists play in Atmosphere Moisture and Storm Mapping Program? What technical jobs are specifically required?</h2>
                <p>Technologists must ensure the instruments used in the AMSMP are up-to-date and function as desired. For instance, they must make sure the AMP uses Global Hawks that use proper equipment that are functional. In addition to maintaining the quality of the instruments, other jobs include modifying them to increase or improve functions and investing or researching better forms of radars or sensors.</p>
                
                <h2>How do technologists and those trades workers collaborate?</h2>
                <p>The trade workers ensure the aircrafts are properly managed and not damaged during flights. Also, they ensure the satellite is always under the control of the AMSMP station. They should communicate with the technologists to find the ideal time to perform these actions. The technologists in turn must make sure the trade workers know about quality or status of the instruments so they do not get damaged during the process.</p>
